When the taskbar is at the top, you can't preview windows anymore and you need to change between application with the alt/win + tab menu.  
You can swap between applications with the taskbar, but only when a single window of the application is opened. When multiple Windows are open, you need to use the alt/win + tab method.  
All in all it's a bit buggy.
